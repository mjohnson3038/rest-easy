<h1>RestEasy</h1>

<p>Summary of my capstone project at Ada Developers Academy. This is a project I really enjoyed and would love to continue in the future. The biggest challenge was deploying. I tried with Elastic Beanstalk which we determined was not compatible with Tesseract OCR and then Heroku which was not compatible with ImageMagick. If I were to do it again, I would begin deploying from the very start of the project to better identify the issue faster and resolve it without having to deal with other features and dependencies.</p>
